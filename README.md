# LizardNet-Minecraft/Overviewer-Config
This repository contains the configuration files used to render the maps for the LizardNet Minecraft servers. The maps
are rendered using [Overviewer](https://overviewer.org/). Likewise, this is primarily for internal use, but the code is
published to allow for easy collaboration and version control.

This repository primarily lives in LizardNet Code Review:
- [Main repository][gitblit]
  - [Alternate view][gitiles]
- [Gerrit dashboard][gerrit-dashboard]

It also is mirrored to GitHub as [LizardNet/LizardNet-Minecraft-Overviewer-Config][github] for convenience. Note that
the mirror is read-only, so changes cannot be directly pushed. Pull requests are welcome, but will be copied to Gerrit
for you for merging.

The repository is heavily based on code by stwalkerster, adapted for use on LizardNet, which can be found at
[stwalkerster/minecraft-overviewer][github-stwalkerster-minecraft-overviewer].
